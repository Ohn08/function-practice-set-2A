1. Create a function that computes the area of a triangle using
Heron’s formula:
Area = √s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)
where s is half the perimeter, or (a + b + c)/2

2. Create a function that determines whether a given year is a
leap year or not. A leap year is a year that is evenly divisible by
4, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible
by 400.
